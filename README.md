# CryptoScratch


	Prepared blockchain and cryptocurrency from scratch in Node.js using test-driven approach and implemented concepts like public/private key usage, 
  mine transactions, proof of work algorithm, real-time peer-to-peer server with Redis pub/sub implementation, RESTful APIs integration to frontend 
  and transaction pool for getting real-time list of incoming data.
	Added a frontend dashboard from scratch in React, using CryptoAPI to display all cryptocurrencies, adding features like choosing favorite currency, 
  charts and also to provide an interface to the blockchain.
